TaskQuest a productivity app that is designed for students. The app helps students manage their group work more efficiently. Its main purpose is to make teamwork and task management easier.
The app is organized into projects and tasks. Students can join projects as team members and see all their assigned tasks. Each task shows who is responsible for what work and when it needs to be done.
To make the app more engaging, students can play mini games and earn awards for finishing their tasks. These awards show how well they work with their team and if they complete tasks on time.
